> # ⚠️ Dear user,
> Titanium and Arctic are two projects of mine and my goal was to implement an intepreted minimalistic programming language.
> These repos probably won't be updated from now on, mainly due to the lack of time and motivation to keep working on those projects.
> However, if you want to try them all, please read their docs and download their interpreters and try writing a few simple programs using them. If you want to clone any of those projects and keep working on them or even use them as a basis for your own programming language, feel free to do so.
